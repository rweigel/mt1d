# mt1d

This repository contains:

* Depth-resistivity profiles for the [USGS](https://github.com/rweigel/mt1d/tree/main/models/USGS) and [Quebec](https://github.com/rweigel/mt1d/tree/main/models/Quebec) 1-D models.
* Code for plotting resistivity vs. depth, apparent resistivity, Niblet-Bostik resistivity, Z, apparent phase, and the impulse response of E to B.

See https://rweigel.github.io/mt1d for a set of plots for various artificial resistivity profiles and comparisons between actual resistivity profiles.
